Troubleshooting SSH and Git Issues on GitHub

Check SSH Key:
Ensure that the SSH key you've added to your GitHub account matches the key on your local machine. Verify that the public key (id_rsa.pub or your custom key's public counterpart) is correctly added to your GitHub account.

SSH Agent:
Confirm that the SSH agent is running and has your private key loaded. You can check the loaded keys with the command:

bash
Copy code
ssh-add -l
If your key is not listed, add it using:

bash
Copy code
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Replace with the path to your private key if it's not the default id_rsa
GitHub Repository URL:
Confirm that the remote URL for your Git repository is correct. You can check this using:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
If the URL is incorrect, you can update it with:

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DynamiteCrow/ShanesRepo.git
SSH Configuration:
Ensure that your SSH configuration is set up properly. Check the contents of your ~/.ssh/config file and make sure it doesn't conflict with your GitHub configuration.

Repository Existence:
Double-check that the repository "ShanesRepo" exists on GitHub.

GitHub SSH Connection Test:
Test your SSH connection to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message indicating successful authentication.

Start SSH Agent:
Start the SSH agent:

bash
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add SSH Key to Agent:
Add your SSH private key to the agent:

bash
Copy code
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Replace with the path to your private key if it's not the default id_rsa
Verify SSH Agent:
Check if your key is added to the agent:

bash
Copy code
ssh-add -l
Restart SSH Agent and Session:
If problems persist, try restarting the SSH agent and your shell session, or reboot your computer.

HTTPS URL as Alternative:
If needed, you can use the HTTPS URL for the remote repository as an alternative:

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DynamiteCrow/ShanesRepo.git
git push -u origin main
Make sure to replace paths and repository URLs with your actual configurations.

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
