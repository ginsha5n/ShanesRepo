Spoke with Jason about inodes, it was actually  interesting.

Fire alarm went off today i didnt bother going out, because if i did i cant get back in
anyways some cheeky f came in and said to me, did you hear the fire alarm? in a cheeky tone
next time he came around like no seriously did i hear it. Why didnt you go out, whats your name
wjo do you work for, dont ever do it again. I almost said the issue is i didnt do anything.
before he walked off i asked sorry whats your name. Dermot something, im assuming hes 
some high up, if not hell be told mind his own business next time if iever see him again.

In reality its probably best i didnt say much, otherwise i would just be getting myself in
more sh1t. But still, he was a cheeky f.
