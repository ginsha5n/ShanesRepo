week 14  
Monday 21/08/23

I need to get through this week and im off next week.
I need to spemd time studying for circuit design because its 10 days away
I missed to standup this morning, it was only Jacob and Harsh in the meeting, Harsh is sound but quiet so i didnt want to go into a meeting 
with Jacob.

i had a great call with Jason, Im going working on a side project instead of work in the team. Which is what i want because i can wokr on something that i find 
intesting, i can learn some Go programming at a level that i can attain

When i work on something, a skill or study or work, theres 3 levels ,
wokring on something i know very well and i can do it
working on something thats difficult, that im not able to get done  so i struggle but i can feel that if i keep working i will get it eventually. I enjoy that work
Then working on something that is completly over my head, i struggle and make no prgress, i dont know whats going on, i end up resenting the work, not caring and not doing it

The past 3 months ive spent most of my time at that third level.
Its like trying to play a video game youve never played before. If you start on level 1 youll pick up and play it happily
If you start on level 5, itll be difficult, you dont know the rules or controls but you start picking them up after a few attempts and before long your preforming at a good level
but if you start on level 20, you going be killed by that first enemy the second you start, the enemy that a player whose gone though the levels defeats easily.
when your working at that level where you cant overcome that first hurdle, your going to quit.

Yeah ive been just been focusing on my study for my repeat exam next week. In my eyes its more important to me to make sure i pass that. If i dont and I end being held up year i will not be able stick it here until January Ill be out the door.


Thanks Jason, and I am sorry for my behaviour it is unprofesional it is childish. Ive been here a few months now and ive just never settled into it, im at my wits end and this exam and few other bits have really put me under pressure in the last week or two. Im off most of next week anyways so maybe ill be able start fresh when i get back.
