When does it come in useful in linux to truncate files??

what problems did i face today:

test product banner,
i didnt know if grep was suitable, or regular expression, the rjl test uses grep so thats went with.
researched the grep commad to see if there was a better way to make suit my situation ie options -x? (went with none
I was able to grep the alpha state message but when it came to the copyright symbale i didnt want to match it to 2023,
looked at regular expressions to see if that would be a better path to explore, in the end i didnt.
then realised the output of grep was a list of everytime the pattern appeared so i turned the output into a string before asserting it mathes what i want.

test truncate,
didnt know what truncate was in linux, looked it up
had difficulty creating the test files, i was attempting to make 1 file than copy it into other files, permission was denied 
just created 2 files, 1 to truncate to 0 and 1 to truncate to 2.

testinvalid command
spent time figuring out how to do that,
