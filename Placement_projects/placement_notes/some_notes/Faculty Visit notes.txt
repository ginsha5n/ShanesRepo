Faculty visit

Didnt get on with my original mentor
Called an ageist by the manger 
never see the manager 
original email sent to placement officer
Never settled into the role
dont see the manager
Never saw the Hr woman she never showed up for our meeting, only go tback to me 2 hours later to set up meeting i took sick the next day and let her know, she never got back into contact
Struggel working from home
I want to work with people my own age, an di wont be called an ageist for it
no peers, no other interns, graduates, junior engineers working here
went a whole week without anyone messaging checking in what im doing or ho im getting on, 
went 2 weeks without a 1:1 chat with anyone
flat organisation with no one to answer to except the manager whos also like project director so i never see him
Poor induction training, it was week 11 before i got an actual conversation on what the project theyre working on actually does, how am i supposed to work on it 
I struggle with the flat organisation. Where i am now i need solid workplace structure, i have my mentor but he isnt a manager he doesnt like to order me around me arounf hes more like what do you want to work on??? I dont know!!!

My access card to the uilding doesnt work, its a loaner badge, never got a official one, the loaner card doesnt work, i let them know, they told me it would work 
again, 2 weeks later it doesnt work again and i dont know who to go to because the manager is unavailable, (flat hierarchy)


Placement log book? I have notes made weekly should i make a document of those and submit alongside
any info on past projects
has there ever been cases of people having to leave placement over being so unhappy with where they are 

I dont like being here and i also dont like being the only whos mood brings down the whole room. Its had a negative effect on me in every aspect, the only way ive gotten over it in my
personal life is by getting rid of the anxiety and after getting rid of that all thats left behind is nothing, i dont care about this place.
